# My First Web Page
First attempt at HTML and CSS

Task was to create a website with a charity theme, in this case I chose a donkey theme.

Secondary task was to make the website responsive, so reacting well to scaling and resizing of the browser window.

Added in interactiveness to the website, making buttons change colour when hovered over and reacting to the users input.
